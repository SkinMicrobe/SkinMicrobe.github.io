# Abstract

With the development of society and the improvement of life quality, more than 500 million people are affected by diabetes. More than 10 % of people with diabetes will suffer from diabetic wounds, and 80 % of diabetic wounds will reoccur, so the development of new diabetic wound treatments is of great importance. The development of skin microbe research technology has gradually drawn people's attention to the complex relationship between microbes and diabetic wounds. Many studies have shown that skin microbes are associated with the outcome of diabetic wounds and can even be used as one of the indicators of wound prognosis. Skin microbes have also been found to have the potential to treat diabetic wounds. The wound colonization of different bacteria can exert opposing therapeutic effects. It is necessary to fully understand the skin microbes in diabetic wounds, which can provide valuable guidance for clinical diabetic wound treatment.
