SMOOTH（Skin & Mucosal Microbiomics Optimizing Total Health ） Laboratory is an interdisciplinary research facility integrating skin microbiome big data with artificial intelligence, affiliated with [Southern Medical University](https://www.smu.edu.cn/). 

The team focuses on multiple domains including skin microbiome and regeneration, barrier repair, wound healing, dermatological diseases, skin-flexible materials, and microbiome big data analytics. We have established multiple large-scale clinical cohorts, curated tens of thousands of clinical raw datasets (totaling ~600TB), and maintain four dedicated servers. Our infrastructure includes a full suite of microbiome research equipment and technologies, supported by specialized bioinformatics personnel. Currently, several major projects are ongoing. Since its establishment three years ago, the team has published numerous first-author papers in high-impact journals and their sub-journals. We particularly welcome candidates with strong backgrounds in big data analysis and microbiome research to join our team!
